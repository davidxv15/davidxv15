## ðŸ“– About This Research  
This repository contains the official preprint for **The Ascensia Effect**, a newly defined behavioral principle that describes **temporary surges in desirable behavior before stabilization.**  
- It explores applications in **AI reinforcement learning, cognitive science, medical research (dementia treatment), emergency response, and human performance optimization.**  
- Introduces the **Jasso Principle (AI)** for cross-domain expertise transfer and **Protenza (Music)** for surges in expressive intensity.
